<h1>SepBIN Details</h1>
<p>
    This page is used as a supplementary web page for our submission "SepBIN: Binary Feature Separation for Better Semantic Comparison and Authorship Verification".
    This page contains download links to our experimental data and the additional technical details document, along with the corresponding introductions.

    </p>

    <h3>Directory Description</h3>
    <p>
        The data/GCJs folder contains processed feature files and ranking pair files for the GCJ-C I, GCJ-C II, GCJ-C++ I, GCJ-C++ II datasets, as described in Section V.A.1.<br>

        The data/obfuscations folder includes processed feature files and ranking pair files for the single and combined obfuscated datasets in Section V.D.1.<br>

        The data/aptmalware folder includes processed feature files and ranking pair files for the APT malware homology detection dataset in Section V.D.2 to V.D.4.<br>

        The data/Github folder includes processed feature files and ranking pair files for the Github dataset in Section I of our supporting documentation.

<h2>Additional technical information</h2>
    <p>
        We provide a document with the additional experimental details of SepBIN, which is available at this
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6lBk8yJUmRMRRXbgC8gxVoHKnxPew9u/view?usp=sharing.">link</a>.
        The document mainly contains the following two parts of contents:

        <h3>Extended experiments on realistic Github dataset</h3>

        We introduce the Github data source to evaluate SepBIN's performance on realistic datasets more comprehensively. The experimental results are shown in Table I and Figure 1. On the Github dataset, the Precision@1 and Recall@5 metrics reach 85.13% and 75.16%, respectively,
        outperforming the Siamese-based baseline model by 8.06 and 6.48 points. And when utilizing different proportions of finetuning datasets,
        SepBIN maintains improvements compared to the baseline model.
        The gains in Precision@1 and Recall@5 metrics range from 2.14 to 11.13 points. Overall, the extended experiments on the realistic Github dataset further prove that SepBIN's network architecture and pretraining-finetuning mechanism can effectively transfer the feature separation ability, benefiting real-world binary authorship verification applications.
        The dataset collection process and experimental results are detailed in the document download link.
